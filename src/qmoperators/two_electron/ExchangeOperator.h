/** @class ExchangeOperator
 *
 * @brief Operator containing a single ExchangePotential
 *
 * The operator is defined as the Hartree-Fock exchange arising from a particular
 * set of orbitals. The OrbitalVector defining the operator is fixed throughout the
 * operators life time, but the orbitals themselves are allowed to change in between
 * each application. The internal exchange potentials (the operator applied to it's
 * own orbitals) can be precomputed and stored for fast retrieval.
